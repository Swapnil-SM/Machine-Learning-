**Real Estate Analysis Using ML and Power BI**  

This project predicts house prices using three models: Random Forest Regressor, Decision Tree Regressor, and Linear Regression, with Random Forest achieving the best performance (RMSE ~2). It features an interactive Power BI dashboard showcasing insights such as house type categorization (Luxury, Affordable, Cheap), error analysis, and actual vs. predicted price comparisons. Python was used for data preprocessing and model training, while Power BI was leveraged for visualization to deliver clear and actionable insights.  

**Tech Stack:** Python, Random Forest Regressor, Decision Tree Regressor, Linear Regression, Power BI, Pandas, Scikit-learn.
